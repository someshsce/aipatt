<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy of **AIPATT** up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before installing and using **AIPATT**, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.10+** - Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Ollama** - To run the language models, you need to install Ollama. You can get Ollama from their [official site](https://ollama.com).
  - Once installed, you can run a model like `llama3.2` using:

    ```sh
    ollama run llama3.2
    ```

  - You can explore other models available on [Ollama's model library](https://ollama.com/search) that supports tools calling.

### Installation

Once the prerequisites are installed, follow these steps to install **AIPATT**:

1. Install **AIPATT** via **pip**:

   ```sh
   pip install aipatt
   ```

2. After the installation, you can start using AIPATT directly in your terminal by running:

   ```sh
   aipatt
   ```

### Configuration

The first time you run **AIPATT**, you will need to configure a few settings. You can either use the default settings or customize them as per your needs. Below are the configuration options you'll need to provide:

1. `DATABASE_PATH`: Default value is available, but you can specify your own database path.
2. `DEFAULT_MODEL`: Default model is set, but you can change it to any available model in Ollama.
3. `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`: You need to get your API key from OpenWeatherMap.
4. `GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL`: The default Google search URL is set, but you can override it.
5. `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`: Get your Custom Search Engine ID from Google CSE.
6. `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Get your Google API Key from Google Cloud Console.
7. `SMTP_SERVER`: Default is set for Gmail, but you can configure your own SMTP server.
8. `PORT`: Default is set for Gmail. If using a different SMTP server, you need to provide the correct port.
9. `USERNAME`: Your email address or username for the SMTP server.
10. `PASSWORD`: Your email password or an app-specific password if using Gmail.
